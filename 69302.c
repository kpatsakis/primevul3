	 * tries to grow the static hugepage pool while alloc_pages() is
	 * called by process A. B will only examine the per-node
	 * counters in determining if surplus huge pages can be
	 * converted to normal huge pages in adjust_pool_surplus(). A
	 * won't be able to increment the per-node counter, until the
	 * lock is dropped by B, but B doesn't drop hugetlb_lock until
	 * no more huge pages can be converted from surplus to normal
	 * state (and doesn't try to convert again). Thus, we have a
	 * case where a surplus huge page exists, the pool is grown, and
	 * the surplus huge page still exists after, even though it
	 * should just have been converted to a normal huge page. This
	 * does not leak memory, though, as the hugepage will be freed
	 * once it is out of use. It also does not allow the counters to
	 * go out of whack in adjust_pool_surplus() as we don't modify
	 * the node values until we've gotten the hugepage and only the
	 * per-node value is checked there.
